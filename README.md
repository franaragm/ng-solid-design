<hr>

*SOLID* is a mnemonic acronym for a set of 5 software design principles as followed:
- Single-responsibility principle
- Open-closed principle
- Liskov substitution principle
- Interface segregation principle
- Dependency inversion principle

In this example Angular web app, we'll take a basic, monolithic to-do app and apply each of the 5 principles to it in phases until our app is completely SOLID.

Start with [Phase 1](/src/app/01-the-monolith) of development to view the monolithic app and begin seeing SOLID applied accordingly.
