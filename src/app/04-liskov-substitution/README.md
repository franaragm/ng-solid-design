  Phase 4: The Liskov Substitution Principle
</h2>

For this fourth phase, we created an `SectionBase` class to allow us to create a layer of abstraction and potentially substitute it for another or extend it rather than needing to update each individual component in `03-open-closed/components/content/`.

Go to [Phase 5](../05-interface-segregation/) to view our app after applying the interface segregation design principle.

Go [back](../03-open-closed).
