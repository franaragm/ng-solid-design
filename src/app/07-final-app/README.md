  Phase 7: The Final App — A° SOLID
</h2>

Finally we have an example Angular app developed with all 5 SOLID design principles.
We can add more components and enhance the SOLID design of the app if we'd like, but I encourage you to compare this final version with our [monolithic app (the single `MonolithComponent`)](../01-the-monolith/) to gather your own insights into the overall level improvement SOLID gives to the scalability and maintainability of Angular apps which use all 5 principles like we've used here.
